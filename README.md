# Macro-Driven Market Pivot Analysis

---

## Overview

From 2018 through 2021, the sneaker and apparel resale market performed well due to strong consumer spending, limited product supply, and healthy resale pricing. Starting in 2022, those conditions began to change.

Inflation increased the cost of everyday necessities, leaving consumers with less discretionary income. At the same time, major footwear and apparel brands increased production and relied more heavily on promotions. Together, these factors reduced resale margins, slowed how quickly inventory sold, and increased the risk of holding product.

Rather than treating these issues as temporary, this project examines economic data and public company financial reports to determine whether the downturn was structural. The analysis explains why moving away from sneakers and apparel and into digital and vintage camera equipment was a data-backed decision.

## Business Question

Did the decline in sneaker and apparel resale represent a short-term slowdown, or a longer-term structural shift that required a change in strategy?

---

## Hypotheses

- Inflation reduced consumers’ real buying power, hitting discretionary products like sneakers and apparel the hardest.
- Major brands increased supply and discounting, weakening scarcity and resale pricing.
- Falling resale prices triggered a cycle of slower sales and higher inventory risk.
- Camera equipment, especially discontinued and vintage models, would hold value better due to practical use and limited supply.

---

## Economic Context

Between 2018 and 2023, inflation steadily increased, raising the cost of essentials such as housing, food, and transportation. While wages rose in dollar terms, they did not keep up with inflation. At the same time, consumers saved less and relied more on credit.

As more income went toward necessities, discretionary spending tightened. Sneakers and apparel are non-essential purchases, making them especially sensitive to changes in purchasing power. Buyers became more price-conscious, resale premiums were harder to maintain, and overall demand weakened.

---

## Brand-Level Supply Dynamics

During this same period, major footwear and apparel brands increased production and used more promotions and markdowns to drive sales.

Financial reports from Nike, Adidas, and Ralph Lauren consistently pointed to:

- Softer consumer demand  
- Increased discounting  
- Pressure on profit margins  
- Elevated inventory levels  

For resellers, this had a direct impact. Frequent restocks and brand-level discounts lowered resale price ceilings. As primary sellers pushed more inventory into the market, resale margins compressed and inventory risk shifted to third-party sellers.

## Macroeconomic Indicators (U.S.)

### Consumer Price Index (CPI)

CPI index values are published by the BLS. Inflation percentages are calculated from index levels.

| Year | CPI Index (Avg) | Cumulative Change vs 2018 |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 2018 | 251.1 | — |
| 2019 | 255.7 | +1.8% |

| 2021 | 271.0 | +8.0% |
| 2022 | 292.7 | **+16.6%** |

---

### Real Wage Growth

Real wage growth is derived by subtracting inflation from nominal wage growth.

| Year | Nominal Wage Growth | CPI Inflation | Real Wage Growth |
|-----|---------------------|---------------|------------------|
| 2021 | ~4.7% | ~7.0% | **-2.3%** |
| 2022 | ~6.4% | ~8.9% | **-2.5%** |

> Nominal wages increased, but purchasing power declined.

---

### Personal Saving Rate

Saving rate is directly reported by the BEA (% of disposable income).

| Year | Saving Rate |
|-----|-------------|
| 2018 | 7.8% |
| 2019 | 7.5% |
| 2020 | 16.3% |
| 2021 | 10.6% |

### Consumer Debt (Revolving Credit)

Federal Reserve G.19 data, values in trillions USD.

| 2021 | 1.03 | +3.0% |
| 2022 | **1.17** | **+13.6%** |

> Rising debt alongside falling savings signals consumer stress.

## Company Financial Trends (2018–2022)

To better understand how brand-level performance translated into resale market conditions,
I analyzed the financial reports of the three primary brands I sold during this period.
Because resale pricing, liquidity, and demand are directly influenced by brand supply,
inventory levels, and promotional behavior, trends in these companies’ financials
provided important context for changes observed in the secondary market.


### Nike (Fiscal Years)

| FY | Revenue ($B) | Gross Margin | Inventory ($B) |
|----|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 2018 | 36.4 | 44.7% | 5.5 |
| 2019 | 39.1 | 44.4% | 6.7 |
| 2020 | 37.4 | 43.4% | 7.4 |
| 2021 | 44.5 | 45.9% | 6.9 |
| 2022 | 46.7 | **45.0%** | **9.7** |

**Derived insights:**
- Inventory rose **+40.6% YoY in 2022**
- Gross margin declined **~90 bps** despite revenue growth

### Adidas (Calendar Years)

| Year | Revenue (€B) | Gross Margin | Inventory (€B) |
|-----|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| 2018 | 21.9 | 51.8% | 4.0 |

---

### Ralph Lauren (Fiscal Years)

| FY | Revenue ($B) | Gross Margin | Operating Margin |
|----|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| 2018 | 6.6 | 63.8% | 11.9% |
| 2019 | 6.2 | 64.2% | 10.4% |

> Even premium apparel experienced severe operating leverage stress during this period.

---

## Cross-Signal Summary (Pre-2023)

- CPI increased **~16–18%** while real wages declined  
- Savings rates fell to **~5%** as consumer debt rose  
- Nike and Adidas inventory surged **~40% in 2022**  
- Gross margins compressed across all three companies  

These signals indicate **structural pressure on discretionary apparel and footwear demand** prior to 2023.

## Resale Market Breakdown

As resale prices declined, the market entered a negative feedback loop:

- Sellers listed more inventory to avoid holding losing assets  
- Increased supply pushed prices down further  
- Buyers waited for better deals  
- Inventory sat longer and cash was tied up  
- Storage and operating costs increased  

What had once been a relatively liquid resale market began to feel risky and inefficient. This shift was driven by economic pressure and oversupply, not by changing consumer preferences.

## Comparative Analysis: Sneakers vs. Cameras

Sneakers and apparel are trend-based products that depend on discretionary spending and controlled scarcity. Camera equipment, by contrast, serves a functional purpose, including content creation and professional use.

Many digital and vintage cameras are no longer produced, meaning supply is fixed. As a result, camera resale prices were more stable, inventory sold more consistently, and the category was less affected by heavy discounting.

---

## Market Validation & Trial Run

Based on the macroeconomic and brand-level analysis, I conducted a trial run to validate whether pivoting into camera equipment was a viable business decision.

The hypothesis was that demand was limited by trust and usability concerns rather than lack of interest.

To test this, cameras were sold as:
- Fully tested and verified  
- Complete kits (battery, charger, SD card)  
- Clearly documented by a consistent seller  

### Customer Willingness to Pay

Customers paid a **30–66% premium** over average marketplace prices for:
- Fully functional, tested products  
- Included accessories for immediate use  
- Reduced risk and higher trust  

---

### Trial Run Results (Month 1)

- **Sample size:** 40 cameras  
- **Channel:** Local marketplaces  
- **Net profit margin:** 44.7%  
- **Sell-through rate:** 80%  
- **Timeframe:** 1 month  

---

### Scale Test Results (Month 2)

- **Net profit margin:** 45.2%  
- **Sell-through rate:** 78%  
- **Inventory:** ~2× prior month  

Margins and sell-through remained stable, indicating demand exceeded supply at this scale.

---

### Validation Outcome

The consistency in results confirmed that:
- Demand was real and repeatable  
- Customers valued trust, completeness, and testing  
- The category supported scalable unit economics  

---

## Strategic Pivot

Inventory decisions were treated as capital allocation decisions. Exposure to volatile, oversupplied categories was reduced, while capital was reallocated toward camera equipment with steadier demand and pricing.

---

## Business Impact

After pivoting fully into camera equipment, the business achieved:

- Faster inventory turnover  
- More consistent margins  
- Lower storage and operating costs  
- Higher average order values  
- Reduced seasonality and volatility  

Camera sales during slower months matched or exceeded sneaker profits during peak periods, with significantly lower risk.

---

## Key Takeaway

The decline in sneaker and apparel resale was driven by reduced purchasing power, increased supply, and heavier discounting—not loss of consumer interest.

Camera equipment proved more resilient due to its utility, durability, and fixed supply. The pivot was a deliberate, data-driven response to market conditions.
